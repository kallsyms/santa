* Use flyweight for cred, program
* Tests
* platform impls for struct pid, struct cred, struct program should be platform independent enough
  * windows?
* HandleExec taking a struct cred, program vs. taking es_event_t?
  * I think taking populated structs is cleaner - converters can be included in the library, but not inline with the mutation methods
* HandleExec should replace item in map entirely with copy to preserve correct parent_ process info?
* track start/end time? or is linux-specific struct pid enough?
* annotation flow
  * evaluator func which specifies fork and/or exec propagation for the given annotation
  * how are annotations exposed?

* in linhelm, does our Process end up being the canonical internal implementation instead of proto?
